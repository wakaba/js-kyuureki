The |kyuureki.js| script provides two functions to convert a Gregorian
calendar date into a Kyuureki (Japanese classic calendar) date, and
vice versa.

The Kyuureki is the calendar system used in Japan before calendar
reform at January 1, Meiji 6 (1873).

This module supports the dates between Gregorian 0445-01-25 (Kyuureki
0445-01-01) and Gregorian 2101-01-28 (Kyuureki 2100-12-29).

A day is identified in Kyuureki by year, month, and day numbers.
There are 12 or 13 months in a year, 12 of them are identified by
numbers 1-12.  The other month is referred to as a "leap month", using
the number of the previous month.  For example, year 2012 has "leap 3"
month between months 3 and 4.  There are 29 or 30 days in a month,
identified by numbers 1-30.

There are these functions:

[y, m, mLeap, d] = Kyuureki.gregorianToKyuureki (y, m, d)

  Convert a date in Gregorian calendar into a date in Kyuureki.

  The arguments must be the year, month, and day numbers.  Note that
  January is month |1|, not |0|.

  It returns an |Array| of the year number, the month number, whether
  the month is a leap month or not, and the day number.

  If the input is outside of the range, an |Array| of four |null|
  values is returned.

[y, m, d] = Kyuureki.kyuurekiToGregorian (y, m, mLeap, d)

  Convert a date in Kyuureki into a date in Gregorian calendar.

  The arguments must be the year number, the month number, whether the
  month is a leap month or not, and the day number.

  It returns an |Array| of the year, month, and day numbers.  Note
  that January is month |1|, not |0|.

  If the input is outside of the range, an |Array| of three |null|
  values is returned.

The input must be a valid Gregorian or Kyuureki date.  Otherwise an
exception might be thrown, or an invalid date might be returned.
